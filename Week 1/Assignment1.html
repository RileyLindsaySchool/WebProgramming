		<h3>Information Technology (Programming, Database, Web)</h3>
		
		<p>
			I am interested in web development primarily because the web is probably the most widely supported software development platform there is;
			you can write a website on a laptop, and expect it to show up on mobile phones, tablets, Xbox's, and even Nintendo DS's.
			Because of this wide-spread support, there are a lot of jobs in things like JavaScript.
			I also like the power of HTML's character encoding, since you can easily insert any type of character if you know the character code,
			such as &#x10900;, which is U+10900, Phoenician/Paleo-Hebrew Aleph.
			It is often much more difficult to work with these kinds of characters in other languages.
